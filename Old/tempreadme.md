from celery import Celery

app = Celery('your_celery_app')

@app.task
def your_task(arg1, arg2, dynamic_priority_value):
    # Your task logic here
    result = arg1 + arg2

    return result

# In your code where you call the task, set the priority dynamically
dynamic_priority_value = 5  # You can calculate this based on your logic
result = your_task.apply_async(args=(arg1_value, arg2_value), priority=dynamic_priority_value)




In this example, the your_task function is a Celery task, and it takes three arguments: arg1, arg2, and dynamic_priority_value. The apply_async method is used to call the task asynchronously, and the priority parameter is set to the dynamically calculated priority value.

You can replace the dynamic_priority_value with your actual logic to calculate the priority based on values in your function. The priority value is an integer, and lower values indicate higher priority.

Keep in mind that the effectiveness of priority settings may depend on the Celery version and the broker you are using (in this case, RabbitMQ). Make sure to check the documentation for your specific Celery and RabbitMQ versions for any additional considerations or settings related to task priorities.







In Celery, lower values for the priority parameter indicate higher priority. Therefore, a priority of 1 is higher than a priority of 10. It follows a convention where lower numerical values represent higher priority levels. So, when assigning priorities, keep in mind that a task with a priority of 1 will be considered more important than a task with a priority of 10.
