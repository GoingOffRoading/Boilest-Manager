# How to use Templates

The input templates have a relatively simple format:

    {
        "config_name": "default",
     
    }

  - watch_folder is the folder Boilest will scan.  This will be whatever directory the media files in the container were mapped to
  - container is the video container or file extension that is desired
  - container_ffmpeg_string is the ffmpeg recognized variable for that container.
